(but sincerely thank you).\r\n\r\n- **Jekyll-Bootstrap Documentation Website.**\r\n  The documentation website at <http://jekyllbootstrap.com> is maintained in the gh-pages branch.\r\n  Please fork and contribute documentation additions to this branch only.\r\n\r\nThe master and gh-pages branch do not share the same ancestry. Please treat them as completely separate git repositories!\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n\r\n## Install jekyll\r\n\r\n  sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1\r\n  sudo apt-get install rubygems\r\n  sudo gem install jekyll\r\n\r\n  jekyll serve\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
